Hey! I need you to build a standalone demo of a Trainer Aide feature for a fitness platform. This is a complete redesign that needs to be better than the existing implementation and reference projects.

📍 PROJECT LOCATION:
/Users/mukelakatungu/trainer-aide-demo

📚 CRITICAL: READ THESE FILES FIRST (in order):
1. ./AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Your complete development guide (READ THIS FIRST!)
2. ./TRAINER_AIDE_DEMO_REQUIREMENTS.md - Detailed technical specifications
3. ./README.md - Quick project overview
4. Trainer aide explaination: /Users/mukelakatungu/trainer-aide-demo/Trainer Aid - Features + User Flow.txt

🎯 WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING:
A high-quality, frontend-only demo with THREE user roles:
- Studio Owner: Create workout templates
- Trainer: Run training sessions using templates (with 3 different sign-off modes)
- Client: View session history

🎨 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
✅ MUST USE: Solid colors only (#a71075, #45f2ff, #00bafc, #0085c4)
✅ MUST HAVE: Clean white cards, consistent spacing, mobile-first design
❌ ABSOLUTELY NO: Gradients anywhere (backgrounds, buttons, borders)
❌ DON'T COPY: The old Wondrous design (it's what we're replacing!)

📱 MOBILE IS CRITICAL:
- Trainers use this in the gym on phones
- 44x44px minimum touch targets
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Perfect mobile UX, not just "responsive"

🏗️ TECH STACK:
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- Zustand for state
- LocalStorage for demo data persistence

🔑 MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES:
1. **Session Runner** with 3 sign-off modes:
   - Full Session: Complete all at once
   - Per Block: Sign off after each block
   - Per Exercise: Check off each exercise individually
2. **30-minute timer** that auto-completes
3. **RPE tracking** (Rate of Perceived Exertion 1-10)
4. **Template Builder** for Studio Owner (flexible, intuitive)
5. **Mobile-optimized** for on-the-go trainers

📊 REFERENCE PROJECTS (Learn from but don't copy):
- wellness-frontend: /Users/mukelakatungu/wellness-frontend/src
  → Study: Clean layouts, component organization
- class-dash-demo: /Users/mukelakatungu/class-dash-demo/src/app/demo
  → Study: Simple cards, no gradients, professional UI
- Current implementation: /Users/mukelakatungu/wondrous-store-platform/src/app/trainer-aide/
  → Study the structure but DON'T copy the design (has gradients)

🚀 START HERE:
1. Read AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md completely (it has everything!)
2. Navigate to: cd /Users/mukelakatungu/trainer-aide-demo
3. Initialize: npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --app
4. Follow the 7-day workflow in the instructions
5. Use the mock data provided in the requirements doc

✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Zero gradients anywhere
- All 3 sign-off modes work perfectly
- Timer works correctly (30 min countdown)
- Mobile experience is excellent
- Better looking than both reference projects
- All data persists in LocalStorage

⏱️ TIMELINE: ~7 days
- Days 1-2: Setup, layout, mock data
- Day 3: Studio Owner features
- Days 4-5: Trainer features (Session Runner is complex!)
- Day 6: Client features
- Day 7: Mobile optimization & polish

❓ QUESTIONS?
Everything is documented in AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md. If you need clarification:
1. Check AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md first
2. Check TRAINER_AIDE_DEMO_REQUIREMENTS.md second
3. Then ask specific questions

🎯 GOAL:
Build a demo that makes the client say "This is EXACTLY what I wanted!"

Let's build something amazing! Start by reading AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md, then begin with the setup phase.
